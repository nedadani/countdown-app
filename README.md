# Countdown App

Countdown App is a simple app made to count the number of days until any particular event. To use it, press "Add new countdown", choose the date, write down the name of the event and press "Save". The application will calculate the number of days until the date and display it. The information you provide is saved to the browser's local storage.

The app was built with a purpose to practice Typescript and unit testing skills, so even though the app itself is not complicated, it helped me to learn two new programming concepts.
